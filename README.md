### Background

# [thanks live][live]

Thanks is a game inspired by Amiga's 1991 hall of famer - Tanx. Like the original, it is a 2-player game and the goal is to destroy your opponent before he destroys you. Players take turns firing projectiles
at each other by specifying the angle and power setting.
